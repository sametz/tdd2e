Using an intranet raspberry pi as the web server.
TDD book references to superlists-staging.ottg.edu changed either to just
superlists-staging (e.g folder/file names), or to the pi's 192.168.x.x address,
depending on context.

In Ch. 10 of the second edition (online pre-release), versions of some of the
 files (e.g. the gunicorn .service and the nginx.template.conf) that at that
 point in time only exist on the pi, with no backup, are being created in the
off-pi git. As a precaution, these files are being cut and pasted below.


/etc/nginx/sites-available/superlists-staging

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name 192.168.1.13;

    location /static {
        alias /home/pi/sites/superlists-staging/static;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_pass http://unix:/tmp/superlists-staging.socket;
    }
}
